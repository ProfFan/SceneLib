Real-time map-building for a single agile camera
------------------------------------------------

This is work in progress...

Approx calibration for firewire cameras; max zoom out.

Distance = 1m

Across: 620 - 420 = 200 pixels; 5 squares + 4 spaces = 9 * 6 = 54cm
Down  : 350 - 150 = 200 pixels; 5 squares + 4 spaces = 9 * 6 = 54cm
